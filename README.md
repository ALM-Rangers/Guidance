## Planning Guidance
The purpose is to build some insightful and practical guidance to replace the aging TFS Planning, Disaster Avoidance and Recovery guidance.

**GUIDELINES**
- Based on [TFS Planning, Disaster Avoidance and Recovery guidance](https://vsardata.blob.core.windows.net/projects/Rangers_vsarPlanninglGuide_Everything.zip) guidance
- Reference product documenation where relevant - do not duplicate
- Article format, length, style, and tone to align with [technical articles](https://aka.ms/devopsarticles)
- Build and review article here. After PO approval, we'll migrate to [technical articles](https://aka.ms/devopsarticles)

Look at aka.ms/devopsarticles to get a feel of the tone and length of articles and familiarise yourself with ALM-Rangers/Guidance where we will create the first DRAFT.
