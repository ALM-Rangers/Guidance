#Effective feature isolation on TFVC

Are you planning to implement Team Foundation Version Control‘s feature isolation strategy ([TFVC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181237.aspx))? You probably have a few questions, such as:

- Is it practical with large development teams?
- Does it align well with your agile process(es)?
- What’s the proper lifetime of isolated feature branches? 

This topic aims to answer those questions, and give you a clear perspective on feature isolation in TFVC. (For guidance on TFVC branch strategies overall, read [Branching Strategies with TFVC](./branching-strategies-with-tfvc.md).) 

> [!NOTE]

> This topic covers TFVC. For Git, refer to [adopt a Git branching strategy](./git-branching-guidance.md). 

#What's feature isolation?

The feature isolation strategy allows you work on your features or fix bugs in **feature** branches (also known as “topic branches”) based off your **main** branch, or **dev**, or other central branches. It isolates your changes from the rest of your team, allows you to experiment with a feature, and enables easy rollback or merging of changes with your parent branch. 

It’s typical to create one feature branch per feature or bug, but in this strategy, you can create a miscellaneous feature branch to isolate a couple of low risk features.

Unlike Git branches, which are repository-scoped, TFVC branches are path-scoped and therefore not as lightweight. To workaround this, limit the number of and the lifetime of your TFVC feature branches, and [optimize your workspace](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/optimize-your-workspace) using explicit, implicit, cloaked, and non-recursive folder mappings, to improve performance, and to reduce required disk space on your machine.

> [!TIP]
> 
> Your workspace should contain only the files you need. Consider creating multiple workspaces to isolate and switch among multiple feature branches. To avoid confusing yourself, use a consistent naming convention for both your workspace and feature branch.

#Naming convention is important
Use a consistent naming convention for your feature branches. Branches should be self-describing and easily identified by your users. Some suggestions:

- features/username/description for work performed by an individual. For example, *features/sandra/sdk-java*.
- features/workitem for feature work associated with a specific work item. For example, *features/115673*.
- sprint/username/description for work done by an individual in a specific sprint. For example, *S53/bill/dictionary-refactor*.
- bugfix/username/bugid for work done specific to an engineering bug. For example, *bugfix/takashi/707*. 

#Creating feature branches

Create a feature branch when you need to work on a feature, typically within the context of a sprint or iteration.

To protect your parent branch and minimize merge conflicts, regularly forward integrate (FI) changes from the parent branch to your feature branch. It ensures that you resolve merge conflicts on your feature branch, not the parent branch.

![Feature isolation drift](./_img/effective-feature-isolation-on-rfvc/feature-isolation-basic-drift.png)

This strategy also keeps features from getting out of sync with the parent branch, especially if your feature work is taking time or is blocked on the integration of another feature. Remember to FI before you reverse integrate (RI) your changes back to the parent branch!

> [!TIP]
>
> Keep your feature branch **short-lived**! 
> 
> Unlike main or other central branches, feature branches have a limited life time. They are scoped to features, bugs, and hot fixes, which are typically developed within a sprint or iteration. Consider removing your feature branch once your feature has met your team's definition of done [DoD](https://aka.ms/vsardod) and changes have been merged with the parent branch.

As the number of your feature branches increase, your storage requirements and branch hierarchy visualization noise increases. With only five feature branches, the diagram is already noisy and rapidly losing its monitoring qualities. Can you imagine the impact of your team creating hundreds of feature branches?

Similarly, the **Source Control Explorer** view becomes noisy and impractical as the number of branches increases. Unless you have a consistent naming convention, finding a specific feature branch among hundreds of feature branches is challenging.

> **Delete** your feature branch when you're done!

#Impact of deleting a feature branch

By [deleting](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/delete-restore-files-folders#delete-an-item) feature branches you minimise noise and focus on active feature development. 

![Delete feature branches](./_img/effective-feature-isolation-on-rfvc/feature-isolation-delete-branches.png)

Remember it's a soft delete and your history is not lost. You can show deleted branches as follows:

- Select **Tools > Options > Visual Studio Team Foundation Server**.
- From the submenu, select **Show deleted items in the Source Control Explorer** to view the deleted branch(es). 

If needed, you can also [restore](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/delete-restore-files-folders#restore-items-deleted-from-visual-studio) deleted branches and associated items. 

![Show deleted feature branches](./_img/effective-feature-isolation-on-rfvc/feature-isolation-delete-branches-show.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use the [destroy](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/tfvc/destroy-command-team-foundation-version-control) command with caution. It's a **permanent** delete!

If no one in your team has destroyed a branch, you'll have the complete history needed for auditing and migration tools that rely on replaying history.

So, by keeping your branches **short-lived** and adopting a **consistent naming convention**, the feature isolation strategy is effective for small and large teams.
