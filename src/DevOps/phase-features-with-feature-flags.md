# Phase the features of your application with feature flags

In today's fast-paced, feature-driven markets, it is imperative to be able to deliver value and receive feedback on features quickly and continuously. Partnering with end-users to get early versions of features vetted out is extremely valuable.

Are you planning to continuously integrate features into your application while they're under development? You probably have a few questions, such as:
- How can you toggle features to hide, disable, or enable features at run-time?
- How can you revert a change deployed to production without rolling back your release?
- How can you present users with variants of a feature, to determine which one performs better?

This topic aims to answer this and share our implementation of feature flags and A|B testing, within our production infrastructure for DevLabs extensions.

## Considerations

Before you introduce feature flags to your engineering process, it's important to consider the following:
- @

## What are Feature Flags (FF)?

@

## What is A|B Testing?

@

## What FF solution did we chose?

@

explicitly invite. 

## Moving features with feature flags in our engineering process

@


## What's the value?

## Conclusion

Now that you've covered the concepts and considerations of feature flags, and our implementation of them, you should be confident to explore ways to improve your CI/CD pipelines. While feature flags come at a cost, having a game plan to manage exposure features at run-time is invaluable.

## Q&A

### Is there a dependency on feature flags?

No, rings and feature flags are symbiotic. Read [Phase the roll-out of your application through rings](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/articles/phase-rollout-with-rings) for details.
