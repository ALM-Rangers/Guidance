# Phase the roll-out of your application through rings

In today's fast-paced, feature-driven markets, it is imperative to be able to deliver value and receive feedback on features quickly and continuously. Partnering with end-users to get early versions of features vetted out is extremely valuable.

Are you planning to build and deploy Visual Studio Team Services extensions to production? You probably have a few questions, such as:
- How do I embrace DevOps to deliver changes and value faster?
- How do I mitigate the risk of deploying to production?
- How do I automate the build and deployment?

This topic aims to answer this and share our implementation of tiers, or rings, within our production infrastructure. For an insight into the guidelines we follow in Microsoft, please read [Configuring your release pipelines for safe deployments](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2017/04/24/configuring-your-release-pipelines-for-safe-deployments/).

Now that you've covered the concepts and considerations of rings, and our implementation of rings, you should be confident to explore ways to improve your CI/CD pipelines. While the use of rings adds a level of complexity, having a game plan to address feature management and rapid customer feedback is invaluable.
