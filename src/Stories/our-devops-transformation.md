- Mature self-organizing, self-managed, and cross-functional teams thrive on autonomy, mastery, and purpose as discussed in DRiVE - by Daniel H.Pink.
- "Information is the oxygen of the modern age. It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire, it wafts across electrified borders.” - Ronald Reagan
- The ride is not over, though. Transformation is part of our ongoing journey.
- Small teams are easy to manage and can modify process quickly to meet work styles. - TK
- I think it’s also easier for a new Ranger to on-board the program. There is no more Ruck guide and other stuff. You just follow aka.ms/sos and you’re done. - WK
- The role of the PM is still critically important. Starting new projects, making sure we finish projects before we start something else, facilitating meetings and scheduling stuff is very important. Without his guidance/structure, I think we would accomplish way less. - WK
- In short the Program Manager is the glue between all of the self-organizing teams. As a result, all Rangers that we interviewed feel strongly that the whole program would fall apart without the PM’s ardent support. Therefore, you may want to consider a similar role at your organization whose sole purpose is to keep your own highly-distributed, self-organizing teams moving forward toward the same organizational goals.
- Since teams are smaller and there are more projects, there is potentially more productivity... unless there are blockers, in which case it can be harder to get help. - DK
Rangers are spread too thin. 
- There are too many projects and not enough bandwidth to deliver quickly. - TK
