# ALM | DevOps Rangers find better ways to deliver value by transitioning to DevOps

The community of volunteers, give professional guidance, practical experience and gap-filling solutions to the developer community. To enable the community to respond to change and deliver value faster, they're transitioning to DevOps using Agile practices and DevOps capabilities using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Microsoft Azure.

## Situation

The Ranger program was created in 2006 as an internal community to "connect the product group with the field and remove adoption blockers". By 2010 the program evolved to include Microsoft Most Valued Professionals (MVP), expanding the community to a geographically distributed community. By 2009, the community had over 200 members, resulting in collaboration and planning challenges, bottlenecks due to dependencies and manual processes, and increasing delays and dissatisfaction with the developer community. 

The community is divided into roughly a dozen active teams. Each team is committed to design, build, and support one guidance or tooling project through its lifetime. In the past, teams typically bottle necked at the team management level, due to a rigid water-fall style process and high dependency on one or more program managers. The program managers intervened in decision making, releases, and driving the **why**, **what** and **how** for projects. Also, a lack of real-time metrics did not enable the teams to effectively monitor their solutions. Users typically alerted the community of bugs and issues.

It was time to find a better way of doing things and delivering value to the developer community.

## Solution

To address these challenges, the community stopped all new feature development for a month to explore [Agile](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-agile/) practices and new products. The aim was to re-energize the community, find ways to promote **autonomy**, **mastery**, and **purpose**, as outlined in [DRiVE](http://www.danpink.com/books/drive/), by Daniel H.Pink, and overhaul the rigid processes and products.

Getting the [culture](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-devops-culture/), the **people**, right was the first step to embrace DevOps. The community implemented the [Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) framework, used [Kanban](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/) to improve the engineering process, and visualization to improve transparency, awareness, and most importantly, trust. With self-organization of teams, the traditional hierarchy and chain-of-command disappeared. Self-management encouraged teams to actively monitor and evolve their own process.

> Mature self-organizing, self-managed, and cross-functional teams thrive on autonomy, mastery, and purpose" - DRiVE, Daniel H.Pink.

In April 2010 the community took another pivotal step. They switched and committed their process, environments, deployments, and architecture to the Visual Studio Team Services ([VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/)) **product**. 

[Continuous integration](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-integration/) (CI) and [continuous deployment](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery/) (CD) replaced rigid manual processes with automated pipelines. This empowered teams to deploy solutions to canary and early adopter users, without intervention from program management. [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) introduced real-time telemetry. This enabled teams to watch their solutions and often detect and address unknown issues before users noticed them.

The DevOps transformation is an ongoing evolution, using experiments to explore and validate people, process, and product innovations. Recent experiments introduced many products that are continuously improving the value flow. [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/) was introduced to automatically, continuously, and silently checking the security, licensing, and quality of open source components. The use of [deployment rings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/articles/phase-rollout-with-rings) and [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) enables teams to have fine-rained control of features for all or specific users. Teams are empowered to deliver quality and value to their end users.

## Benefits

Embracing DevOps enabled the Ranger community to become nimble, realize faster-to-market and quicker-to-learn-and-react processes, reduce the investment of precious family time, and introduce proclaim autonomy.

## Key outcomes ##

Here's a list of key outcomes, listed in not specific order:

- There's no blueprint - every organization and every team is unique!
- Start with something tangible and iterate - avoid the big-bang.
- The most challenging part of transformation are the **people** (culture).
- Use engineering process to reinforce desired behaviour!
- Transparency and visibility is key!
- Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose are core!
- Transformation is continuous!
