#Introduction
##Value for the reader to read this ebook
For many years, we've been evaluating and implementing Agile practices across our geographically distributed, part-time, and volunteered-based teams. While we shared our learnings in the [Managing Agile OSS Projects with Microsoft VSO](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft_press/2015/04/09/free-ebook-managing-agile-open-source-software-projects-with-microsoft-visual-studio-online/) eBook, we realized we're not done. We need to scale, and more importantly, deliver value to our developer community quickly. 

We embarked on a cultural shift that allowed us to "rub DevOps" on our operational processes, and embrace self-organized, self-managed and autonomous teams. This article explores self-organized teams, our journey, and behavioural patterns we observed. 

> Whether you read the entire article or cherry-pick topics, please bear in mind that there is no silver bullet, or one size fits all. The patterns and recommendation covered herein may or may not apply to your organization. If they do, we hope we'll enable a successful transformation for you teams. If not, we'd appreciate your candid feedback, so that we can update this article.

##What's a ...

Teams are a grouping of individuals who are dependent on each other to pursue a common vision, achieve a common goal, and deliver a valuable solution to its users. Our teams are made up of 6-9 part-time volunteers, each with a unique set of skills and real-world experience, working together for a reasonable period, typically three to four 3-week sprints.

Before we started our transition, we relied on traditional **managed** teams. The program manager (PM) set the vision, selected the projects, and managed the unified process and all teams. The structured hierarchy relied on top-down management and bottom-up reporting between the program manager and the project leads (PL), leaving team members with limited authority.

With **self-organized** teams, the traditional hierarchy and chain-of-command is disappearing for us. 

- The role of the program manager has evolved from management to enablement. 
- The project lead is still pivotal to drive the team's energy and momentum, but no longer reports to the PM.
- Each team shares the point-of-contact (PC) responsibility, enabling shared status knowledge and continuous collaboration.

###Self-organizing team?

As suggested by the [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) our "*self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team*". None of our teams are the same and there is no silver bullet, or secret sauce, to become a self-organized team. 

Some key observations within our environment:

- It's not a once-off transition! We're continuously observing, learning, adapting, evolving our environment.
- Every team member must self-organize! There is no central control or micro-management. 
- Team members must trust and respect each other! Members who are not engaged or go dark, destroy self-organized teams.

###Self-managing team?

Self-managing teams not only choose how best to accomplish their work, but also for manage their engineering process. Building upon organizational processes, these teams adapt their process within the boundary and context of their team.

Some key observations within our environment: 
- Many teams standardize on [Kanban](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/kanban/kanban-basics), focusing on moving their work from left (new) to right (done), and relying on PM enablement to minimize bottlenecks. 
- Successful self-managed teams actively monitor and evolve their process. 

###Cross-functional team?

Cross-functional teams "*have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team*" - [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). Once cross-functional teams embrace self-organization and self-management, they become an inspiring autonomous team within teams.

> [!NOTE]

> Mature self-organizing, self-managed, and cross-functional teams thrive on **autonomy**, **mastery**, and **purpose** as discussed in [DRiVE - by Daniel H.Pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgGhSOAtAyQ).
